```
As we can see skewness in -0.3 which means age is approximately symmetric. As if skewness is in between scale of (-0.5 to 0.5)it will be considered approximately symmetric.


#### so in age as we can see the outliers are value 30 which are outside of 1.5*IQR . We are going to use capping methiod in order to treat outlier. For missing values that lie outside the 1.5*IQR limits, we could cap it by replacing those observations outside the lower limit with the value of 5th %ile and those that lie above the upper limit, with the value of 95th %ile.

```{r Outliertreatmentofage}

boxplot(cd$age, main="Age", boxwex=0.1)

```
#### As we can see there are few of outliers in Height variable , which is around .004 percent of total data. since this is continous data so we are going treat with capping method. For missing values that lie outside the 1.5*IQR limits, we could cap it by replacing those observations outside the lower limit with the value of 5th %ile and those that lie above the upper limit, with the value of 95th %ile. Moreover the skewness is around -0.63 which means height column is left skewed.

mtext(paste("Outliers: ", paste(outlier_values, collapse=", ")), cex=0.6)

```
#### As we can see now there are no outliers in height column.Also  earlier there was skewness in the column and it was (-0.63) but after the outlier treatment it reduces to 0.09 . so height variable is not skewed.so we are good to go.

```
#### As we can see there are 10 % of data which are outlier . Also data is highly asymmetric as skew value is (1.01) which meamns age is highly right skewed.we will first treat outlier ,then we will check if skewness persists then we will apply transformation on the weight column.

```
#### As we can see there is a 8 units of difference in mean and Meadian.which is really high . But the outliers are only around .05 % . This means that the values of outliers are of very values. Aslo the skew and kurtosis (85.29,7579.32)values are really very high. which again point to the fact that some values are incorrect or garbage values . we are to going treat the outliers in the next section and then we will analyse our column again.

```

#### yes we were absolutely right the outliers were of very high and they were garbage value.After treating outliers , we can see our sweet boxplot(without any outliers) .Moreover our skew value is now under approximately normal range which is 0.54.

```

#### As we can see there is difference of 16 units in mean and median.From the histogram we can see that data is right skewed which is around (32.11). Also the kurtosisis really high. there are around 10% outliers so we are going to treat it.after that we are going to check again

#### As we can see now after treatment of outliers , skew has also been in expected range(0.48) . now our variable is approximately normally distributed.

temp_min = pmin(cd$ap_hi, cd$ap_lo)
cd$ap_hi = pmax(cd$ap_hi, cd$ap_lo)
cd$ap_lo = temp_min
```
#### since diastolic and systolic are connected and diastolic will always be greater than systolic . so for sanity we have implement few changes to swap values if sysytolic is less than diastolic

```

#### From factor analysis we have taken 3 factors in account as per factor loadings. and those are bmi , api_hi , height. So we are good to go for our model implementation.

## Calculating BMI
