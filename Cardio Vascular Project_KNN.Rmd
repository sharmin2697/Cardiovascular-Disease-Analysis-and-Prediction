### VISUALISATION
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#age count , affected vs not affected
counts <- table(cd$cardio, cd$age)
barplot(counts, main="Age distribution",
  xlab="Age", ylab="Counts", col=c("darkblue","red"),
  legend = rownames(counts), beside=TRUE)

```
We see that most people who are suffering are of the age 56, followed by 58.
Majorly, people belonging to the age group 50+ are suffering from the disease.


```{r}
library("ggplot2")

cd$cardio<-as.factor(cd$cardio)


ggplot(data=cd, aes(x=gender, y=age, fill=cardio)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
